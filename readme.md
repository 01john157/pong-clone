### Requirements
- [MSYS2](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_installing-the-mingww64-toolchain): follow the 'Installing the MinGW-w64 toolchain' instructions.
- [Make](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm): after installation, add `\bin` to your path.
- [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/latest): get SDL2-devel-x.x.x-mingw.
- [SDL_Mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases/latest): get SDL2_mixer-devel-x.x.x-mingw.
